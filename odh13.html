  <h1 style="font-size:40px">MY SHADOW  </h1>
  <h6">I am about as detailed as a shadow.Friendship is the shadow of the evening, which increases with the setting sun of life.
   </h6>
  <pre style="font: Lumanosimo; font-size:20px">
    I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
    And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
    He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
    And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.


    The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow
    Â­Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
    For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
    And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.

    He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
    And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
    He staysso closebeside me,he'sa  coward you can see;
    I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!


    One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
    l rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup; 
    But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
    Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.
